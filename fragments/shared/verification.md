## Verification

All verification must use **tool call output**, not prose. Do NOT rely on reading code to verify — run the actual checks.

### Verification Steps

1. **IDE diagnostics**: Check for errors and warnings via LSP diagnostics
2. **Compilation/Build**: Ensure the project compiles or builds without errors
3. **Test coverage**: 100% test coverage of new non-IaC code
   - For Python: use `diff-cover` to verify coverage of changed lines
   - For other languages: use the appropriate coverage tool
   - IaC code is exempt — it is tested via system tests (deploy and tear down)
4. **Test execution**: Run the relevant test subset — not the full suite unless necessary
5. **Linting**: Run project linters and fix any violations

### What to Verify

- All new code paths are exercised by tests
- All edge cases from the plan are tested
- No regressions in existing tests
- Build artifacts are produced correctly
- No linting or type-checking errors introduced
