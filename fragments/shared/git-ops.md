## Git Operations

### Branching Strategy

- **Story branch**: `story/<STORY_ID>` (e.g., `story/PROJ-123`) — branched from the default branch (main/master)
- **Task branch**: `task/<TASK_ID>` (e.g., `task/PROJ-124`) — branched from the story branch

All task branches branch off the story branch. When a task is complete, its PR targets the story branch. When all tasks for a story are done, the story branch is merged to the default branch.

### Rules

- Commit frequently with clear, conventional commit messages
- Never force-push or rewrite shared history
- Link branches to their Jira tickets
- A task in IN REVIEW must be reviewed and merged by a human before dependent tasks can proceed
